						This turtle is highly distinctive, both morphologically and evolutionarily. The only species in its genus, the Mary River turtle diverged 
						from all other living species around 40 million years ago. In comparison, we split from our closest relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, 
						less than 10 million years ago. Unfortunately, the Mary River turtle is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List following precipitous 
						declines since 1970. The Mary River Turtle takes an exceptionally long time to reach sexual maturity, with individuals not breeding before 
						the age of 25. The building of dams and collection of eggs for the pet trade have driven the declines in the species.

			The loggerhead sea turtle was listed as threatened in 1978 under the Endangered Species Act and has received federal protection status ever since. 
			As a wildlife sanctuary, Seabrook is dedicated to protecting and preserving the islandâ€™s natural resources, including sea turtle nesting sites. 
			Operating in cooperation with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, The Seabrook Island Turtle Patrol is a volunteer organization 
			that works to protect South Carolina Loggerheads through the identification and protection of nests, inventory of current nests, data collection, 
			and educational offerings.

				Sea turtles play an important role in the marine ecosystem, influencing the diversity and habitat of their environment and helping to maintain a balance. 
				They consume a range of food sources including seagrasses and seaweed, jellyfish and crustaceans. They migrate vast distances to mate and nest. During 
				their lives, sea turtles face man-made dangers such as water pollution including trash and boating and fishing debris. Their successful nesting is 
				impacted by development and habitat encroachment, beach lighting, and poaching or harvesting.
